# Frontend

This project is built with Vite and React.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open the URL shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner using Vitest.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and your app is ready to be deployed from the `dist` directory.

### `npm run preview`

Runs a local static web server that serves the files from `dist`. This is useful for checking the production build locally.
